Tutorial on: Vehicle path following and control

This project considers example implementations and demonstrations for several aspects of car-like vehicle control, motion/path planning, e.g., for autonomous driving purposes. The examples are implemented using model-based programming for dynamic systems in Python [Openrtdynamics](https://github.com/OpenRTDynamics/openrtdynamics2). Some modules are also exported to Simulink S-functions via automatic code generation.

Topics might be (to be further defined)

- Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) ✅ [bicycle-model](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/bicycle_model.html) 

- Lateral/Longitudinal acceleration

- Path following / steering control (basic)  ✅ [path-following control](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/path_following_control.html) 

- Path following / steering control based on path curvature ✅ [path-following control (curvature-based)](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/path_curvature_following_control.html) 

- Lateral dynamics ✅ [lateral dynamics](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/path_following_lateral_dynamics.html) 

- Path following (open-loop) ✅ [path-following open-loop control](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/path_following_open_loop_control.html) 

- Trajectory tracking control
- Frenet transformation of the KBM
- Motion planning [basic lateral planning](https://github.com/christianausb/vehicleControl/blob/main/lateral_path_transformation.ipynb) 
- Path planning ✅ [driving to given destination](https://github.com/christianausb/vehicleControl/blob/main/path_planning_to_goal.ipynb)
- Safety Functions
- Trailers

Further, this projects implements a path tracking module that can be used to track the projection of the vehicle position on a given path (the paths are dynamically extensible to enable endless driving). It allows to sample data like position, heading, and curvature from the path. Further it allows to calculate the lateral distance to the path. This module is available (via generated c++ S-functions from Python) for controller design or simulation in Matlab/Simulink. You might consider the notebook [code generation]https://github.com/christianausb/vehicleControl/blob/main/generate_simulink_blocks.ipynb) for more information. Simulink examples are given in the folder  
[sfunctions]https://github.com/christianausb/vehicleControl/blob/main/sfunctions).

Example tracks
--------------

Paths are encoded as arrays of position, heading, and curvature over a distance parameter. For example tracks generated by the path optimization bz TUM can be used directly:

Requirements
------------

- openrtdynamics2 (modelling of dynamic systems): $ pip install openrtdynamics2
- emscripten (https://emscripten.org/), the compiler command 'emcc' is required to compile the generated c++ code into web assembly.


Run the HTML-based examples
---------------------------

Start a http-server to be able to access the *.html files, e.g.:

python3 -m http.server
